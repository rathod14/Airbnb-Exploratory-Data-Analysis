# Airbnb-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
In this project, we have analysed the Airbnb houses in Amsterdam using the Airbnb public data.

## Motivation
Airbnb renting has always been interesting. Some spots can be rented in higher prices, whereas others can only be rented in very low prices. Suppose you would like to be a host in Amsterdam - in order to be a successful one, it is a good idea to investigate the host listing data from airbnb and see what are the major factors that influence the room prices. In this project, we are going to do this job for those who want to be a successful host!

Airbnb has seen a meteoric growth since its inception in 2008 with the number of rentals listed on its website growing exponentially each year. Airbnb has successfully disrupted the traditional hospitality industry as more and more travellers, not just the ones who are looking for a bang for their buck but also business travellersâ€™ resort to Airbnb as their premier accommodation provider. Are you planning your trip to Amsterdam and searching for a place to stay on Airbnb? Before diving into thousands of listings posted online, you might be interested in some of the high-level information about the Amsterdam Airbnb market.

## Results

Here are my recommendations:
If you want to rent your house in Amsterdam on Airbnb:
1. If you have a house in the popular neighbourhoods, then congratulations, you can rent your house in a good price.
2. Ask for reviews from your guests. People trust on the previous review than your description and pictures. Showing on time when checking-in, being honest and providing good service (such as allowing extra guest) can really helpful on gaining higher review scores.

If you are going to visit Amsterdam and want to live in a local house:
1. The more bedrooms and bathrooms in the house, the price can be more expensive. If you can find more travelling partners who don't mind sharing bedrooms or bathrooms with you, the average price per person can be very fair.
2. It is always expensive to live in the centre. If you really care about living close to centre, I recommend to live in the neighbourhood of Oud-West which has the most number of houses but the median price ranks the 5th expensive neighbourhood. If you have an empty wallet, considering the mature public transportation network of Amsterdam, I recommend to live in the neighbourhood far away from the centre. Even if you live the suburb, a less than 30-minutes train can take you to the centre.
3. Places having many restaurants and shopping places nearby can be expensive. You can choose other places if you don't necessarily eat or shop near the place you live.
4. If you are a night owl and a lover to night clubs of Amsterdam, unfortunately, you might need to prepare more budgets on accommodation.

There are might be other factors can affect the price such as the decoration of the property and the service the host can provide. Unfortunately, we can't go through the influence of all of possible factors due to the unavailability of the data. However, I believe that our analysis is extremely valuable for the hosts from Amsterdam who wants to define the price of their proprieties or tourists who want to have an estimate of the accommodation cost based on their requirements and budgets. This analysis can also be applied to any other city in the world.
